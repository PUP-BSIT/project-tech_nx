              dogs, hamster, bird, rabbit and cats in the poorest communities of

              Founded in 2024 by Alimas Eliza, Alona Pepito, Precious Pasion,
              Sofia Barrantes and Mikaella Tayoto after the five found an team
              where hundreds of animals were waiting to be euthanized by
              electrocution. Unable to erase the images of the suffering animals
              from their minds, the Five members have dedicated their lives to
              working with the Taguig Government, community partners and
              volunteers to improve the plight of homeless dogs, bird, hamster,
              rabbit and cats in the poorest communities of the Taguig. As a
              result of their tireless efforts, thousands of homeless animals
              have been rescued, sheltered, rehabilitated and ready to meet
              their soon loving families.
