            <h1>ABOUT US</h1>
            <p>
              PAWTECHNX is a nonprofit team whose mission is to help homeless
              dogs, hamsters, birds, rabbits, and cats in the poorest communities of
              Taguig City with food, shelter, medical care, adoption, and
              humane treatment. PWATECHNX also offers to rehome the animals
              that we rescue for their better life.
            </p>

            <p>
              Founded in 2024 by Alimas Eliza, Alona Pepito, Precious Pasion,
              Sofia Barrantes, and Mikaella Tayoto after the five found a team
              where hundreds of animals were waiting to be euthanized by
              electrocution. Unable to erase the images of the suffering animals
              from their minds, the five members have dedicated their lives to
              working with the Taguig Government, community partners, and
              volunteers to improve the plight of homeless dogs, birds, hamsters,
              rabbits, and cats in the poorest communities of Taguig. As a
              result of their tireless efforts, thousands of homeless animals
              have been rescued, sheltered, rehabilitated, and are ready to meet
              their soon loving families.
