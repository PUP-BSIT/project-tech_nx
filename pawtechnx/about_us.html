            <p>PAWTECHNX is a nonprofit team whose mission is to help homeless 
                dogs, hamster, bird, rabbit and cats in the poorest communities

                animals that we rescue for their better life.</p>
                
            <p> Founded in 2024 by Alimas Eliza, Alona Pepito, Precious Pasion,
                Sofia Barrantes and Mikaella Tayoto after the five found an 
                team where hundreds of animals were waiting to be euthanized 
                by electrocution. Unable to erase the images of the suffering 
                animals from their minds, the Five members have dedicated 
                their lives to working with the Taguig Government, community 
                partners and volunteers to improve the plight of homeless 
                dogs, bird, hamster, rabbit and cats in the poorest 
                communities of the Taguig. As a result of their tireless 
                efforts, thousands of homeless animals have been rescued, 
                sheltered, rehabilitated and ready to meet their soon loving 
                families. </p>

                medical care and humane treatement and care to homeless 
                animals in Taguig City.</p>
